# This module is used when no remote temperature device is present.  It basically works 
# around limitations in ESPHome in which build time compile errors cannot be avoided if
# entities (scripts, devices, etc). are not defined.   So this module essentially 
# creates a no-op script to enable build time compilation.
#

script:
  # Helper script called when the climate mode changes.
  - id: climate_mode_changed
    then:
      - lambda: |-
          ESP_LOGI("main", "Climate mode change: %d", id(${hp_id}).mode);
