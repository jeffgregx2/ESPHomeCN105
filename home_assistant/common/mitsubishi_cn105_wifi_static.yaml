#
# This package contains the Wifi configuration setup using static IP address.  For simple
# network configuration the dynamic configuration works well.  However if you have subnets, 
# etc. then the static configuration with a defined wifi_domain is generally better.
#
# This package requires the following substitutions to be defined:
#
#  - Wifi Setup
#        wifi_static_ip      -> static ip address
#        wifi_gateway_ip.    -> gateway ip address
#        wifi_subnet.        -> IPv4 subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0)
#        wifi_ssid           -> SSID of wifi network to use
#        wifi_password       -> Password for wifi network 
#        wifi_domain         -> Default domain name to use, allows non ".local" domains
#
#  - Wifi Access Point Fallback
#        wifi_ap_fallback_ssid      -> Fallback Access Point SSID
#        wifi_ap_fallback_password. -> Fallbcak Access Point Password

wifi:
  ssid: ${wifi_ssid}
  password: ${wifi_password}
  domain: ${wifi_domain}

  manual_ip:
    static_ip: ${wifi_static_ip}
    gateway: ${wifi_gateway_ip}
    subnet: ${wifi_subnet}

  # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: ${wifi_ap_fallback_ssid}
    password: ${wifi_ap_fallback_password}
